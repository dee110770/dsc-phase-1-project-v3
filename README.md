# Aircraft Category Safety Analysis


## Overview

This project analyzes the resource needs of the [Aviation data] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses). Descriptive analysis of aircraft incident data reveals that certain aircraft categories exhibit higher risk levels, and the frequency of incidents varies over time. This analysis can help our company identify low-risk aircraft options, optimize maintenance schedules, and enhance safety protocols to support informed decision-making in the aviation sector.


## Business Problem

This project aims to identify low-risk aircraft models for our company's expansion into commercial and private aviation. By analyzing historical data on aircraft safety and performance, we will provide actionable insights to help make informed purchasing decisions, reduce operational risks, and maximize return on investment.

## Data

This is a dataset from the National Transportation Safety Board, which includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023. This dataset covers civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.

## Methods 

This project employs descriptive analysis to examine trends in aviation incidents over time and across different aircraft categories. By leveraging historical data, the study identifies patterns in safety, injury rates, and operational failures to provide a comprehensive overview of aviation safety records.

## Results

Our analysis reveals that airplanes have the highest number of injuries and incidents, indicating significant safety concerns. Helicopters and gliders also show notable incidents, but in much smaller numbers compared to airplanes. Additionally, many incidents occur under favorable weather conditions, emphasizing the need for robust safety measures even in clear weather.

Our analysis also shows that airplanes have the highest number of non-fatal injuries, nearing 40,000, significantly more than other aircraft types. Despite this, there is a downward trend in airplane accidents over the years, likely due to improved safety measures and maintenance practices. Helicopters, Ultralights, and Gliders have fewer injuries compared to airplanes, with categories like Balloons and Blimps showing the least number of injuries.

## Conclusions

- Incident Trends- Airplanes show a steady decline in incidents despite high traffic, reflecting improved safety protocols and the importance of regular maintenance.

- Aircraft Categories: Different aircraft types, like helicopters and gliders, have varying risk levels; buyers should align choices with operational needs and safety records.
 
-Safety Factors: Incidents in favorable weather highlight the need for strong safety measures and comprehensive pilot training.

### Next Steps 

- Weather Analysis: Investigate how specific weather conditions contribute to incidents and develop predictive models to mitigate risks, such as rerouting during adverse conditions.

- Interactive Dashboards: Build visual tools to explore safety trends across aircraft categories, models, and flight phases, highlighting traffic and injury patterns over time.

- Geographic Analysis: Visualize how incident locations correlate with injury severity and aircraft safety records.
